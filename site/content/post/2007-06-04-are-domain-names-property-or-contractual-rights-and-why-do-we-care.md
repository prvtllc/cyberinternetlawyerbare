Some courts have held that that  <a href="http://www.cyberinternetlawyer.com/Domain_Name_Disputes.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" >domain names</a> are property.&nbsp; In _Kremen v. Cohen_, 337 F.3d 1024 (9th Cir. 2003), the plaintiff registered the domain name sex.com.&nbsp; The registrar transferred the name to a different individual on the basis of a forged letter.&nbsp; The Court reversed the district court’s holding that domain names were intangibles not subject to conversion.&nbsp; The Court held that the registrar was subject to liability “for giving away someone else&#8217;s property.”&nbsp; Id. at 1035.

Other courts, however, have concluded that &#8220;a domain name registration is the product of a contract for services between the registrar and registrant.”&nbsp; _Network Solutions, Inc. v. Umbro Int&#8217;l, Inc_., 259 Va. 759, 770 (2000) (_citing Dorer v. Arel_, 60 F. Supp. 2d 558, 561 (E.D. Va. 1999)).&nbsp; 

If considered property rights, domain names would be subject to state property laws and state property causes of action, such as conversion, would be applicable.&nbsp; However, if domain names confer only contractual rights, the nature of the protection afforded to the registrant would be quite different.&nbsp; 

Under ICANN rules, a domain name owner must intervene within five days to stop an inter-registry transfer request.&nbsp; Therefore, whether a domain name is treated as property or as a contractual right can make a huge difference in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cyberinternetlawyer.com" rel="nofollow" >remedies available</a> to victims of domain name hijacking who do not intervene within the five-day period prescribed by ICANN.
