The Anti-cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) makes those who register infringing domain names in bad faith liable to civil suits from a trademark owner. &nbsp;

Microsoft has filed a  trademark infringement suit against a California dentist, Dr. Saed Said, who has registered more than 40 Internet domains with names similar to Microsoft’s products or brands, including: aMicrosoftShop.com, aMicrosoftStore.com, XboxOutlet.info and XboxMarket.mobi.

Microsoft claims that Dr. Said operates the domains with the intent to divert Internet surfers looking for Microsoft’s products. The person has been diverted from the Microsoft Web site he or she was seeking to visit, and Microsoft has lost the opportunity to interact with that person, Microsoft claims in the lawsuit. According to Microsoft, Said profited from the misdirection because his Web sites contain advertising for non-Microsoft products.
