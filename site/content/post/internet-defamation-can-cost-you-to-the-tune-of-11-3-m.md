Internet blogs continue to create litigation. The days when the courts would not intervene in matters involving Internet defamation resulting from Internet blog postings are behind us. Recently, a Florida woman was awarded $11.3 million dollars in damages resulting from postings made by a Louisiana woman accusing the Florida woman of being a "crook", a "con artist" and a "fraud."

The defendant in that case was not represented by counsel at the time the verdict was issued. Although it appears that in this case, the Defendant was affected by Hurricane Katrina in a manner that affected her ability to defend herself, the situation brings up a significant issue. Many misunderstand the impact and importance of Internet defamation accusations. The result can be financially devastating.

Bloggers and cyber gripers run a significant risk when they post their statements online.  There is no such thing as a completely "anonymous"  blog post. A competent Internet defamation lawyer who knows the technical aspects of the Internet and knows how to properly utilize the legal process can discover the identity of the author. At that point, the author must be prepared to utilize the services of a competent attorney to provide expert legal defense.
