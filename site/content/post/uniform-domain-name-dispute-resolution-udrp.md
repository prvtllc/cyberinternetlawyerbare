### Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy- UDRP Arbitration

The Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy, also known as UDRP is an arbitration process that may be used for resolving domain name disputes without the need to file a domain name dispute lawsuit.  The UDRP procedure is overseen by the  <a href="http://www.icann.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" >Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)</a>.

The  UDRP is a very useful tool. Trademark owners and others asserting an ownership interest in a domain name can us use the proceeding to obtain or recover a domain name.  Many UDRP decisions result from domain name disputes when someone has registered a domain name that allegedly infringes on a trademark.

UDRP arbitration is also useful when someone registers a domain that is confusingly similar to another's domain name, trademark, or trade name. To prevail in an UDRP domain name dispute proceeding, the  complainant must prove that:

1. the domain names are either identical or confusingly similar;
2. that the registrant has no legitimate interest in the name, and
3. that the registration and use of the domain name is in bad faith.

Our UDRP attorneys provide legal consultatuion for all issues related to UDRP proceedings.
