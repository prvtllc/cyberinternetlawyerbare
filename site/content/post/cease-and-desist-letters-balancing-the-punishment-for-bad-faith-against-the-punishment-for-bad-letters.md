There is no doubt that cease and desist letters serve a very important purpose in the litigation process, particularly in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cyberinternetlawyer.com" rel="nofollow" >legal matters related to the Internet</a>.&nbsp; Many causes of action have bad faith as either an essential element or a factor that increases damages.&nbsp; A party’s refusal to correct its acts after receiving a legitimate cease and desist notice can be interpreted as a sign of bad faith.&nbsp; Although a recipient of a cease and desist notice has every right to decline pre-litigation requests without adverse consequences, he must do so in good faith.&nbsp; Good faith means a reasonable belief of having the right to engage in the challenged behavior.&nbsp; However, this “good faith belief” will not be interpreted broadly.&nbsp; See, for example, Northern Light Tech., Inc. v. Northern Lights Club, 236 F.3d 57, 65 (1st Cir.2001) (approving district court&#8217;s use of defendant&#8217;s disregard of legitimate cease and desist letters as evidence of bad faith). 

The question then becomes whether the recipient of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cyberinternetlawyer.com/Cease_and_Desist_Letter.html" rel="nofollow" >cease and desist letter</a> willfully refused to comply with the law.&nbsp; The answer involves an inquiry into the recipient’s state of mind.&nbsp; In many cases there is no direct evidence of bad faith, however, the court may infer bad faith from the surrounding circumstances.&nbsp; Therefore, if you receive a legitimate cease and desist letter from an attorney you should either cease the challenged behavior, or seek the immediate help of a competent attorney for candid advice as to whether your behavior violates the law.&nbsp; You should select an attorney who is familiar with the area of law that is at issue. 

If you receive a cease and desist letter from us, you can be sure that we will advice our client to seek additional remedies if the matter cannot be adequately resolved.&nbsp; The letter may concern <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cyberinternetlawyer.com/Copyright_Infringement.html" rel="nofollow" >copyright infringement</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cyberinternetlawyer.com/Trademark_Infringement.html" rel="nofollow" >trademark infringement</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cyberdefamationlawyer.com" rel="nofollow" >defamation</a>, or other Internet legal matters.&nbsp; Ignoring the letter is usually a bad bet, as the court may see it as a sign of bad faith.&nbsp; The defense side of a courtroom is not a pleasant place to be.&nbsp; 

However, we understand that some attorneys venture into sending letters that make no legal sense.&nbsp; I have previously commented about <a target="_blank" href="http://cyberlawyerblog.com/2007/05/25/the-intellectual-property-lawyers-cease-and-desist-letter-sometimes-the-hired-guns-paper-bullets-cant-pierce-through-the-opponents-armor.aspx" rel="nofollow" >cease and desist letters and how ineffective they can sometimes be</a>.&nbsp; Some of these letters are so far-fetched, unrealistic, and unprofessional that many do not take them seriously.&nbsp; Hence, the Third Circuit Court’s decision on Green v. Fornario, 486 F.3d 100 (3rd Cir. 2007).&nbsp; 

In Fornario, the plaintiff sent a cease and desist letter that included a threat from the attorney to refer the “conduct to the appropriate <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cyber-crime-defense.com" rel="nofollow" >criminal authorities</a>.&#8221; The small problem: this was a trademark dispute and the Lanham Act is a purely civil statute.&nbsp; The big problem: lawyers should take threatening criminal prosecution very seriously.&nbsp; In many States, a lawyer cannot threaten criminal prosecution for the purpose of gaining an advantage in a civil case. 

The Fornario court refused to find that the defendant’s refusal to cease the allegedly infringing behavior was in bad faith.&nbsp; Whether the court would have reached a different decision if the cease desist letter from the attorney been of better quality and without idle threats of criminal prosecution is anybody’s guess.&nbsp; In Northern Light Tech. the court viewed the defendant&#8217;s disregard of legitimate cease and desist letters as evidence of bad faith.&nbsp; To reconcile the decisions probably requires an understanding of the difference between bad faith and bad cease and desist letters.
