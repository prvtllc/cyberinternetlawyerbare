The Anti-cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) makes those who register infringing domain names in bad faith liable to civil suits from a trademark owner. &nbsp;

Microsoft has filed a  <a href="http://www.cyberinternetlawyer.com/Trademark_Infringement.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" >trademark infringement</a> suit against a California dentist, Dr. Saed Said, who has registered more than 40 Internet domains with names similar to Microsoft’s products or brands, including: aMicrosoftShop.com, aMicrosoftStore.com, XboxOutlet.info and XboxMarket.mobi.

Microsoft claims that Dr. Said operates the domains with the intent to divert Internet surfers looking for Microsoft’s products. &#8220;The person has been diverted from the Microsoft Web site he or she was seeking to visit, and Microsoft has lost the opportunity to interact with that person,&#8221; Microsoft claims in the lawsuit.&nbsp; According to Microsoft, Said profited from the misdirection because his Web sites contain advertising for non-Microsoft products.
