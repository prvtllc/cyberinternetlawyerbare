    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The DMCA and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cyber-crime-defense.com" rel="nofollow" >Computer Fraud</a> and Abuse Act are two of the most widely misused Internet related laws.&nbsp; From doctors trying to use the DMCA to shut down a website containing photos of the website owner’s body portraying potential medical malpractice to websites containing “<a href="http://www.cyberinternetlawyer.com/Internet_Contracts.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" > Terms of Use</a>” which prohibit competitors from even viewing the website, these Internet Laws are being abused.<br /></font>

    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><br />The latest incident occurred when a law firm was accused of violating the DMCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act when it used the “Way Back Machine” to recover old Web pages of its client&#8217;s opposing party.&nbsp; Obviously, the firm’s intent was to use the pages to defend its client.&nbsp; The pages were made available only to other lawyers at the law firm.&nbsp; At the time the law firm retrieved the web pages, there no protective measures in regard to the archived pages.&nbsp; <br /></font>

    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><br />Judge Kelly put a stop to this abuse of <a href="http://www.cyberinternetlawyer.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" > Cyber laws</a>.&nbsp; He stated that &#8220;It would be an absurd result if an attorney defending a client against charges of trademark and copyright infringement was not allowed to view and copy publicly available material, especially material that his client was alleged to have infringed.&#8221;&nbsp; Judge Kelly also added that the law firm &#8220;was justified in viewing and printing as many versions of the website as necessary to show that the material had been made public. More importantly . . .&nbsp; the material was relevant evidence in the Underlying Litigation, and the firm had a duty to preserve relevant evidence.&#8221;<br /></font>

    <font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><br />I am sure that the abusive use of the DMCA and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act will continue, but in a federal court in Pennsylvania, Judge Kelly made the right decision.
