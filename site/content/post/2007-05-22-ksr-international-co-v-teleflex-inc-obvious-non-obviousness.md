Teleflex International Co. held a patent titled “Adjustable Pedal Assembly With Electronic Throttle Control.”&nbsp; One of the claims of the&nbsp;patent describes a mechanism where an electronic sensor is combined with an adjustable pedal to control the throttle in an automobile.&nbsp; KSR International Co. added an electronic sensor to&nbsp;its previous automobile pedal design and Teleflex _obviously_ sued for patent infringement.&nbsp; 

The&nbsp;District Court dismissed the case, holding that&nbsp;the claim contained in Teleflex&#8217;s patent was obvious.&nbsp; The Federal Circuit reversed, applying its&nbsp;&#8220;Teaching, Suggestion, Motivation&#8221; test.&nbsp; Under this test, the combination of existing processes&nbsp;to create new processes is not obvious when&nbsp;there is no prior art that explicitly or implicitly teaches, suggests, or motivates the combination.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Supreme Court reversed, holding that&nbsp;the Federal Circuit&#8217;s application of the test&nbsp;need not become “rigid and mandatory formulas” and finding that&nbsp;“any need or problem” can provide the patentee with a reason for combing processes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Supreme Court&#8217;s new obviousness standard will probably increase <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cyberinternetlawyer.com" rel="nofollow" >litigation</a> on obviousness grounds (the Verizon v. Vonage appeal comes to mind)&#8230; However, the&nbsp;full impact of the new obviousness standard is certainly _non-obvious_.
