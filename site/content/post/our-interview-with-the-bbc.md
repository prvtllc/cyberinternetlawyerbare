Last Friday, I had the pleasure of being invited for an interview with reporter Alex Ritson from the  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" >BBC</a>. I appeared on his satellite radio broadcast where we discussed issues related to  <a href="http://www.cyberdefamationlawyer.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" >Internet Defamation</a>, the Communications Decency Act immunity, the differences between a service provider and a content provider, the Wikileaks case, and related Internet Law matters.
