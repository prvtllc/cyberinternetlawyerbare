On May 31, 2007, the&nbsp;BBC&nbsp;reported “U.S. Arrests Internet spam king” Robert Soloway.&nbsp;&nbsp; (A copy of the Article can be found at: <a class="" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6707333.stm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" >http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6707333.stm</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Mr. Soloway is accused of being “responsible for tens of millions of unsolicited e-mails promoting his own company between November 2003 and May 2007” in violation of the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing (CAN-SPAM) Act of 2003.

The  <a href="http://www.cyberinternetlawyer.com/Commercial_Email_Spam.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" >CAN-SPAM Act</a> is codified under 15 U.S.C. § 7701-7713.&nbsp; Contrary to the belief of many, the CAN-SPAM Act does not prohibit sending spam emails.&nbsp; Instead, it imposes certain requirements.&nbsp; These mandatory requirements include, inter alia, the use of accurate email subject lines and transmission information, opt-out procedures where recipients can elect not to receive additional emails fom the sender, mandatory timeframes for the removal of users who elect to opt-out, and a prohibition of improper email harvesting.&nbsp; 

But, what happens when a sender complies with all the requirements of CAN-SPAM?&nbsp; Can an ISP still refuse to deliver compliant email messages to the intended recipients? 

In _White Buffalo Ventures, LLC v. University of Texas_, 420 F.3d 366 (5th Cir. 2005),&nbsp;the Plaintiff, White Buffalo, was an online dating service operating several online dating websites, including one that targeted students of the University of Texas (UT).&nbsp; White Buffalo&nbsp;obtained the non-confidential, non-exempt email addresses held by UT through a Public Information Act request.

White Buffalo used these email addresses to send CAN-SPAN compliant commercial emails to members of the UT community. UT issued a cease and desist letter but White Buffalo refused to comply. As a result, UT blocked all emails originating from White Buffalo’s IP address. 

White Buffalo sued UT, arguing that the First Amendment and the CAN-SPAM Act precluded UT’s actions.&nbsp; The Court disagreed and held that the CAN-SPAM Act does not prevent Internet Service Providers (ISPs), in this case UT, from filtering CAN-SPAM compliant commercial emails.

The lesson to senders of commercial email: Non-compliance with CAN-SPAM will probably result in <a href="http://www.cyber-crime-defense.com" target="_blank"  rel="nofollow" >criminal prosecution</a>, but compliance does not guarantee that an overzealous ISP will deliver the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cyberinternetlawyer.com" rel="nofollow" >legally compliant emails</a> to its intended recipients.
