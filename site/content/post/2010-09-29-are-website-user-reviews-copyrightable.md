  Internet review sites continue to gain popularity. Users can find a website where they can review just about anything. From whether they like the breakfast bar at a particular hotel to their
  Toyota's breaking capabilities (or lack thereof), from whether their obstetrician is friendly enough to whether their plastic surgeon made their nose a bit too pointy. If an Internet user wants the
  world informed of his or her every interaction with the outside world, there is a platform out there to accommodate that.</span>

    <span style="font-size: 16px">The<br /> question is, are these reviews copyrightable material.

    <span style="font-size: 16px">According<br /> to the notes of committee on the Judiciary (1976) for 17 U.S.C. §<br /> 102, “[t]he phrase &#8216;original works of authorship,&#8217; which is<br /> purposely left undefined, is intended to incorporate without change<br /> the standard of originality established by the courts under the<br /> present copyright statute. This standard does not include<br /> requirements of novelty, ingenuity, or esthetic merit, and there is<br /> no intention to enlarge the standard of copyright protection to<br /> require them.” Additionally, regarding the nature of copyright,<br /> the notes further state that “[c]opyright does not preclude others<br /> from using the ideas or information revealed by the author&#8217;s work. It<br /> pertains to the literary, musical, graphic, or artistic form in which<br /> the author expressed intellectual concepts” (emphasis added).</span>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
    <span style="font-size: 16px">It<br /> is well-established that facts cannot be copyrighted. Rather, the<br /> United States Supreme Court has held that “[t]he copyright is<br /> limited to those aspects of the work—termed &#8216;expression&#8217;—that<br /> display the stamp of the author&#8217;s originality.” <em>Harper Row,<br /> Publishers Inc v. Nation Enterprises</em>, 471 U.S. 539, 547, 105 S.Ct.<br /> 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985). However, “[c]reation of a nonfiction<br /> work, even a compilation of pure fact, entails originality.” Id.</span>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
      <span style="font-size: 16px">The<br /> Supreme Court held:</span>
    </p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
      <span style="font-size: 16px">To<br /> qualify for copyright protection, a work must be original to the<br /> author. Original, as the term is used in copyright, means only that<br /> the work was independently created by the author (as opposed to<br /> copied from other works), and that it possesses at least some minimal<br /> degree of creativity. To be sure, the requisite level of creativity<br /> is extremely low; even a slight amount will suffice. The vast<br /> majority of works make the grade quite easily, as they possess some<br /> creative spark, &#8220;no matter how crude, humble or obvious&#8221; it<br /> might be. Id., § 1.08. Originality does not signify novelty&#8230;</span>
    </p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
      <span style="font-size: 16px"><em>Feist<br /> Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Company, Inc.</em>, 499 U.S.<br /> 340, 345, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) (emphasis added,<br /> internal citations omitted). “[O]riginality requires independent<br /> creation plus a modicum of creativity”, and “creativity” is<br /> “limited to &#8216;original intellectual conceptions of the author.&#8217;” <em><br /> Id</em>. at 346.</span>
    </p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
      <span style="font-size: 16px">Even<br /> compilations of facts can be copyrighted, though the copyright is in<br /> the compilation itself and not the facts. As the Feist court<br /> explained:</span>
    </p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
      <span style="font-size: 16px">Factual<br /> compilations&#8230; may possess the requisite originality. The<br /> compilation author typically chooses which facts to include, in what<br /> order to place them, and how to arrange the collected data so that<br /> they may be used effectively by readers. These choices as to<br /> selection and arrangement, so long as they are made independently by<br /> the compiler and entail a minimal degree of creativity, are<br /> sufficiently original that Congress may protect such compilations<br /> through the copyright laws.<em> Id</em>.<br /> at 348. “[I]f the compilation author clothes facts with an<br /> original collocation of words, he or she may be able to claim a<br /> copyright in this written expression.” <br /> </span>
    </p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
      <span style="font-size: 16px">The<br /> U.S. Court of Appeals for 4th Circuit noted that “&#8230; copyright does not secure an exclusive<br /> right to the use of facts, ideas, or other knowledge. Rather, a<br /> copyright gives an author exclusive rights only with respect to his<br /> manner of expression.” <em>Bond v. Blum</em>, 317 F.3d 385, 394 (4th Cir.,<br /> 2003) (emphasis added). “The copyright is the author&#8217;s right to<br /> prohibit the copying of the author&#8217;s intellectual invention, i.e. the<br /> originality of an author&#8217;s expression. Since individual expressions<br /> of ideas inevitably vary, the originality inherent in each author&#8217;s<br /> expression is the essence of the proprietary interest protected.”<br /> <em>Superior Form Builders, Inc. v. Dan Chase Taxidermy Supply Co., Inc.</em>,<br /> 74 F.3d 488, 492 (4th Cir., 1996). What is copyrightable is the<br /> author&#8217;s original expression of the facts, not the facts themselves,<br /> and the Supreme Court has held that only a minimal amount of<br /> “creativity” is needed to be considered “original.” <br /> </span>
    </p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
      <span style="font-size: 16px">The<br /> question of whether factual works are copyrightable thus focuses on<br /> the original contribution of the author – how the author presents<br /> the facts, how the author chooses, interprets, or analyzes those<br /> facts, the words and terms the author uses to couch those facts, etc.<br /> The Southern District of New York explained it as thus: “[copyright<br /> law] afford[s] protection only to the author&#8217;s manner of expression,<br /> that is, the author&#8217;s analysis or interpretation of events, the way<br /> he or she structures material and marshals facts, the author&#8217;s choice<br /> of words, and the emphasis the author gives to particular<br /> developments.” <em> Werlin v. Reader&#8217;s Digest Ass&#8217;n, Inc.</em>, 528 F.Supp.<br /> 451, 461-462 (S.D.N.Y., 1981).Thus,<br /> this Court holds that the Review qualifies as a copyrightable work. </span>
    </p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
      <span style="font-size: 16px">Therefore,<br /> a review is copyrightable as the author&#8217;s independent creation and<br /> original expression of facts. The reviewer&#8217;s choice of words,<br /> interpretation and analysis of the facts, structuring of the review,<br /> etc. satisfy the minimal creativity standard set by the Supreme Court<br /> to meet the “originality” requirements of the Copyright Act. <br /> </span>
    </p>
    
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
      <span style="font-size: 16px">Therefore, by refusing to remove reviews at the request of the<br /> original author, the website owner is potentially exposed to a<br /> copyright infringement claim. The ISP immunities under Section 230<br /> of the Communications Decency Act do not apply to copyright claims. </span>
