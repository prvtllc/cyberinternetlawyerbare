Today, a federal jury acquitted Adil Cassim who was represented by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cyberinternetlawyer.com" rel="nofollow" >Domingo J. Rivera</a>.&nbsp; The United States Department of Justice had alleged that Adil Cassim was the leader of Rabid Neurosis (&#8220;RNS&#8221;).&nbsp; On the DOJ website, the press release alleged that &#8220;according to the indictment, the defendants, led by Cassim for a  
period of time, allegedly conspired to illegally upload to RNS  
thousands of copyright protected music files, which were often  
subsequently reproduced and distributed hundreds of thousands of times. According to the indictment, RNS was a &#8220;first-provider&#8221; or &#8220;release  
group&#8221; for pirated music and other content to the Internet. Once a  
group obtains and prepares infringing digital copies of copyrighted  
works, the copies can then be distributed in a matter of hours to  
secure computer servers throughout the world. According to the  
indictment, RNS members were granted access to massive libraries of  
pirated music, video games, software and movies by gaining a reputation  
for providing previously unavailable pirated materials. The indictment  
alleges that <span lang="EN-CA"><br /> t</span><span lang="EN">he supply of pre-release music was often provided by music industry<br /> insiders, such as employees of compact disc (CD) manufacturing plants,<br /> radio stations and retailers, who typically receive advance copies of<br /> music prior to its commercial release.<a target="_blank" href="http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2009/September/09-crm-940.html" rel="nofollow" >Read the USDOJ press release here.</a></p>
