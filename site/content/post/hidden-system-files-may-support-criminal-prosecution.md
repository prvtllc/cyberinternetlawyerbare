We recently completed an Internet crime trial.&nbsp; The large majority of the prosecution&#8217;s evidence was found in hidden system files of a computer running Windows XP.&nbsp; These files could not be retrieved without the use of software not standard in Windows and which is not available to unsophisticated computer users.&nbsp;
