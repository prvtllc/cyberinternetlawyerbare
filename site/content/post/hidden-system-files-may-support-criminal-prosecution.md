We recently completed an Internet crime trial.&nbsp; The large majority of the prosecution's evidence was found in hidden system files of a computer running Windows. These files could not be retrieved without the use of software not standard in Windows and which is not available to unsophisticated computer users.

It took dedication and patience to explain to the court the inner workings of hidden files such as thumbs.db.  Without the ability to effectively describe the operation of the Windows Operating System it would have been impossible to obtain a favorable outcome for our client. Without this specialized technical competence, taking this case to trial, as opposed to pleading to whatever could be gotten from the prosecutor, would have been insane.&nbsp; Without expertise about computer operating systems and the Internet, it is very difficult for an attorney to be effective when trying a computer or cyber crime case.

As far as I know, we are the only Internet Law Firm that has an attorney who is also a  Computer Engineer with in depth technology experience, including critical projects with the Department of Defense. We can apply our unique computer and  knowledge to any  cyber crime matter.
