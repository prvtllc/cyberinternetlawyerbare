Internet blogs continue to create litigation.&nbsp; The days when the courts would not intervene in matters involving Internet defamation resulting from Internet blog postings are behind us.&nbsp; Recently, a Florida woman was awarded $11.3 million dollars in damages resulting from postings made by a Louisiana woman accusing the Florida woman of being a &#8220;crook&#8221;, a &#8220;con artist&#8221; and a &#8220;fraud.&#8221;&nbsp; 

The defendant in that case was not represented by counsel at the time the verdict was issued.&nbsp; Although it appears that in this case, the Defendant was affected by Hurricane Katrina in a manner that affected her ability to defend herself, the situation brings up a significant issue.&nbsp; Many misunderstand the impact and importance of Internet defamation accusations.&nbsp; The result can be financially devastating.

Bloggers and cyber gripers run a significant risk when they post their statements online.&nbsp; There is no such thing as a completely &#8220;anonymous&#8221; blog post.&nbsp; A competent Internet defamation lawyer who knows the technical aspects of the Internet and knows how to properly utilize the legal process can discover the identity of the author.&nbsp; At that point, the author must be prepared to utilize the services of a competent attorney to provide expert legal defense.
