### Trademark Infringement in Keyword Search Advertisement

Web searches are the primary method used for finding goods and services on the Internet.  Businesses frequently compete for the best search engine positions.  Some may try to use a competitor's name or the name of the competitor's product as a keyword for keyword search advertisement purposes.  As your online trademark infringement lawyers, we provide you advice on how to protect your Intellectual Property against all Internet based trademark infringement, particularly trademark infringement arising from a keyword search advertisement campaign.

**Can a business use its competitor’s name and/or trademark as a search keyword without engaging in online trademark infringement?**

A trademark infringement lawyer with our firm will assist you in determining whether a business' use of a trademark, trade name, or products as a search engine keyword qualifies as Internet trademark infringement. We diligently assist our clients in the prosecution of those who infringe on your trademarks online.

If you have been accused of Internet trademark infringement or if your website has been removed from search engine listings based on a claim of trademark infringement, we can assist you in protecting your rights against the claims asserted by a competitor, perhaps through a cease and desist letter by an  "Internet Lawyer", Intellectual property and trademark infringement attorney or through formal legal action.  It is our job to explain the benefits and drawbacks of specific strategies, it is yours to decide which one to choose, based on your needs, the costs of each alternative, and a sound risk/reward analysis.
