      At the Rivera Law Group Internet Law practice, we have a vast amount of
      experience in Internet Law cases and litigation.  We are a pioneering
      Cyber Law firm that knows when to fight for our client and when to make
      the absolute best of an already difficult situation.  Sometimes, an
      Internet attorney has to be prepared to make recommendations to a client
      regarding the client’s legal situation.  As a result, we have won online
      defamation cases under circumstances that fellow attorneys thought were
      impossible.  We have obtained acquittals in cases involving complex
      allegations of computer crimes.  Similarly, we have obtained pioneering
      court decisions in cases involving unauthorized computer access (hacking)
      between family members.  We have also assisted clients in difficult cases
      of trademark infringement and domain name disputes.  Some of these would
      have been almost impossible to win at trial, but we settled with the
      opposing side without the need for our client to pay anything to the other
      side.


      We have been criticized for our methods to uncovered the identity of
      anonymous creators of defamatory posts.  Sometimes we follow traditional
      legal approaches, such as subpoenas, but always craft methods based on our
      superior technical understanding of Internet technology.  We understand
      that it is easy to criticize things you don’s know enough about and that
      most attorneys are not trained as Computer Engineers.   However, that is
      our advantage and we have an obligation to use our skills to our client’s
      benefit.

      authorship of defamatory posts in online sites, Internet blogs or Internet
      forum.  These posts are damaging to your reputation and legitimate
      businesses.   Further, some of these websites leverage the Communications

      amicable settlement, sometimes it takes aggressive litigation.  It always
      takes skill and understanding of cutting edge technology and its

      use of meta-tags, domain names, and other situations.  We have prevailed
      after hotly contested litigation and have secured orders on behalf of our
      clients forcing the opposing party to stop using our client’s trademarks
