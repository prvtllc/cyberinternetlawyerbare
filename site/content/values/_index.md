      authorship of defamatory posts in online sites, Internet blogs or Internet
      forum.  These posts are damaging to your reputation and legitimate
      businesses.   Further, some of these websites leverage the Communications

      being spread through the use of the Internet affects you.  Also,

      the posts.
