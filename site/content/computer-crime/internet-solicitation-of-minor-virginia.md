### Internet  Solicitation of a Minor

Internet solicitation of a minor is widely prosecuted Nationwide.  Our attorneys defend against charges of Internet solicitation of a minor in Virginia and Nationwide, when requested by our clients. State and local Police Departments have created departments dedicated to Internet solicitation of a minor.  Often is that case that a person will be in a chat room and someone claiming to be a minor will initiate engage in chat with an adult about sexual topics.  This &#8220;minor&#8221; is usually a Police Officer with the Internet child solicitation task force.

Many times the person chatting with this Police Officer posing as a &#8220;minor&#8221; never had the intention to actually meet the &#8220;minor.&#8221;  It is always important to ask whether the person actually went to meet the minor, the age representations that were made, and the methods used to collect and manipulate the evidence.

However, regardless of whether the meeting takes place, felony charges will most certainly be brought.
